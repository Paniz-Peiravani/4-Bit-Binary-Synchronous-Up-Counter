The purpose of this project is to design a 4-bit Binary Synchronous Up Counter using Electric software. Specifically, we aim to create a 4-bit up binary ripple counter that counts from 0000 to 1111. We designed our 4-bit Binary Synchronous Up Counter using JK flip-flop master-slave with two AND gates to generate the required counter output. Additionally, we incorporated preset and clear functionalities to prevent unknown states that could lead to incorrect counter operation. After designing our JK flip-flop, we cascaded it to create a 4-bit JK flip-flop. To ensure the proper functionality of our design, we performed DRC checks for our schematic, as well as both Well check and DRC for layout to make sure our design works properly. Furthermore, we used IRSIM and LTSpice to validate our design by comparing waveforms to the truth table. We will continue to use LTSpice to further validate our designs and extract parasitic elements in our layout. Finally, we performed calculations for various measurements in our design, such as delay, power dissipation, chip area, timing, and number of transistors. For this project based on the requirement we used 175nm or ùû¥=1 for our design.
